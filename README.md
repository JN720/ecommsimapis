# E-Commerce Simulator APIs
This repository contains the backend for the E-Commerce Simulator application and uses Go, PostgreSQL, and Firebase Auth for the backend. The project is currently not active but may resume in the future. The planned final project would include a cross-platform frontend built in Flutter and a Python API for AI-powered search prediction and recommendations.
